      "Bash(git -C \"D:\\sourceProject\\repos\\PlaycanvasAssetProcessor\" commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nFix preset management: suffix persistence, case-insensitive matching, and allow deletion\n\nCRITICAL FIXES:\n\n1. Fix preset suffix saving/loading persistence\n   - User presets with same name as built-in were being skipped during load\n   - Now properly replaces built-in preset with customized version\n   - Suffixes and all other customizations now persist correctly\n   \n2. Clean up case-insensitive matching\n   - Already worked, but code simplified for clarity\n   - Removed redundant variable in MatchesFileName()\n   \n3. Allow deletion of ALL presets (built-in and user)\n   - Built-in presets: now can be \"hidden\" (added to hidden list)\n   - Customized built-in presets: deletion reverts to default\n   - User presets: deleted normally\n   - Hidden built-in presets can be restored via \"Reset to Defaults\"\n   \nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:\n\nPresetManager.cs:\n- Added _hiddenBuiltInPresets HashSet to track hidden built-in presets\n- Changed save format to PresetData class with UserPresets + HiddenBuiltInPresets\n- LoadPresets() now skips hidden built-in presets\n- LoadPresets() properly replaces built-in presets with user customizations\n- DeletePreset() handles three cases: built-in, customized built-in, pure user\n- ResetToDefaults() now clears hidden list and reloads all built-in presets\n\nPresetManagementWindow.xaml.cs:\n- Removed restriction on DeleteButton for built-in presets\n- Added contextual delete messages based on preset type\n- Shows different warnings for hiding vs reverting vs deleting\n\nPresetData class:\n- New internal class for JSON serialization\n- Contains UserPresets and HiddenBuiltInPresets lists\n\nMIGRATION:\nOld JSON files (just preset array) will be migrated automatically.\nThe first save will convert to new format with PresetData structure.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
